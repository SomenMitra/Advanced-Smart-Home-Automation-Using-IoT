# Advanced-Smart-Home-Automation-Using-IoT
Collabed with group of 3 members to acomplish this project. Here we Performed an apk based voice modulation integrated Home Automation System.

This project presents the overall design of Home Automation System (HAS) with low cost 
and wireless system. It specifically focuses on the development of an IOT based home 
automation system that is able to control various components via internet or be 
automatically programmed to operate from ambient conditions. In this project, we design 
the development of a firmware for smart control which can successfully be automated 
minimizing human interaction to preserve the integrity within whole electrical devices in the 
home. We used Node MCU, a popular open source IOT platform, to execute the process of 
automation. Different components of the system will use different transmission mode that 
will be implemented to communicate the control of the devices by the user through Node 
MCU to the actual appliance. The main control system implements wireless technology to 
provide remote access from smart phone. We are using a cloud server-based
communication that would add to the practicality of the project by enabling unrestricted 
access of the appliances to the user irrespective of the distance factor. We provided a data 
transmission network to create a stronger automation. The system intended to control 
electrical appliances and devices in house with relatively low cost design, user-friendly 
interface and ease of installation. The status of the appliance would be available, along 
withthe control on an android platform. This system is designed to assist and provide 
support inorder to fulfil the needs of elderly and disabled in home. Also, the smart home 
concept in the system improves the standard living at home
